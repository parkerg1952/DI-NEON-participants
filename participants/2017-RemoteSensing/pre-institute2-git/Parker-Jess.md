## Geoffrey (‘jess’) Parker

I'm a Forest Ecologist at the Domain 2 relocatable site (Smithsonian Environmental Research Center).  I’m interested in how canopy structure affects forest functions at ecosystem scales.
   
## My goal

To understand the structure of the NEON LIDAR and hyperspectral datasets, learn how to query those datasets and make visualizations to answer basic questions.   

## Project Objective 

Test whether forest reflectance is related to the texture of the outer canopy.  I’d like to test this with AOP data from within and between several forest sites.  For the cross-site comparison I’d like to use data from 2 closed canopy sites - the within-site comparison would use plots of distinct structure (age or disturbance history) at each location.  

## Resoirvces needed

This project will need statistics extracted from the canopy height distributions produced by the LDAR data.  It will also require estimates of total solar albedo from the hyperspectral data.  By combining these, we can then test the hypothesized relation between canopy surface and reflectivity.  Some of the challenges to meet the objectives are how to:  1.) spatially combine the footprints of both types of observation, 2.) choose the right measures of texture and reflectivity, and 3.) objectively identify stands of distinct and uniform structure for the comparison.
